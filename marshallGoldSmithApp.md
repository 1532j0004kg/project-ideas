This process, which I call the Daily Questions, keeps me focused on becoming a happier, healthier person. It provides discipline I sorely need in my busy working life as an executive coach, teacher and speaker, which involves travelling 180 days out of the year to countries all over the globe.

As I argue in my latest book, authored with Mark Reiter, Triggers: Creating Behavior that Lasts – Becoming the Person You Want to Be, in every waking hour we are being triggered by people, events, and circumstances that have the potential to change us. The Daily Questions provide an antidote to that chaos.

The process appears to be almost robotically simple: in effect, I’m taking a test I wrote, to which I already know the answers. But after years of dedication to this process, I now hold the counterintuitive belief that the Daily Questions are in fact a very tough test, one of the hardest we’ll ever take.

To understand why, you first need to grasp a fundamental truth about human behaviour. Changing it is hard. Very hard. I like to say that behavioural change is just about the hardest thing for sentient human beings to accomplish.

In conjunction with Doctor Kelly Goldsmith, they show with impressive results that answering just these 6 questions on a daily basis significantly affects your levels of improvement in areas such as personal engagement, happiness, meaning in life, achievement, joy and passion. In fact, you can add or invent any state or feeling and it could be yours within a few weeks.

These are the 6 daily questions that Professor Goldsmith recommends to start with: 

- Did I do my best to be happy?
- Did I do my best to find meaning?
- Did I do my best to be fully engaged?
- Did I do my best to build positive relationships?
- Did I do my best to set clear goals?
- Did I do my best to make progress toward goal achievement?

After just two weeks where participants asked themselves these questions every day, results showed that:

34% of people said they improved in all of the six areas
67% said they improved in four out of the six areas
91% said they got better in at least one of the areas
and nobody said they got worse.
