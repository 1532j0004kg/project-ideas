Building your own voice controlled HAL9000 for a ~$100. Build it **[here](http://www.instructables.com/id/RaspberryPI-HAL9000/)**, with the step by step instructions. Using a Raspberry PI computer with some other computer components, and a custom acrylic box to create this iconic computer from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey.
