What if I said that there’s a camera that:

Is low cost at $65.
Runs MicroPython.
And can be expanded with shields just like an Arduino/RPi.
Meet OpenMV!

I met Kwabena Agyeman, the founder of OpenMV, during the PyImageSearch Gurus Kickstarter campaign in January 2015.  At that time, Kwabena and the OpenMV team were running a Kickstarter of their own. Kwabena’s Kickstarter raised a lot more funds than mine, which really demonstrates (1) the value of the OpenMV product and (2) the eagerness of the embedded community to work with such a tool.

Since the OpenMV Kickstarter, the OpenMV team has been on a mission to provide a low cost, Python-ready, and easy to use camera system for developers and engineers working on embedded computer vision projects.

Given the success of OpenMV so far, perhaps it’s no surprise that there is an active community of developers. You’ll definitely have the support needed to make your project a success. When I started building the barcode scanning system for this post I was incredibly impressed by the responsiveness of their users and forums.
