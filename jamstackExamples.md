# JamStack

https://jamstack.org/examples/

When is your site not built with the JAMstack?
Any project that relies on a tight coupling between client and server is not built with the JAMstack. This would include:

A site built with a server-side CMS like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, or Squarespace.
A monolithic server-run web app that relies on Ruby, Node, or another backend language.
A single page app that uses isomorphic rendering to build views on the server at runtime.
