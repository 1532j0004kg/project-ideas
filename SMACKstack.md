Leading businesses are building systems of real-time insights to create new opportunities and deliver new value. Common projects include real-time personalization, anomaly detection, predictive analytics, proactive maintenance and IoT. Unlike “big data” from a decade ago, where data scientists batch process data warehouses to find insights and then recommend ways to capture value, modern fast data applications have real-time big data built-in.

For a technology stack to thrive in this always-connected and data-driven world, it has to meet a new set of requirements: ingest data at scale without loss (this can data streaming from millions of user interactions or IoT sensors), analyze the data in real-time, trigger actions based on the analyzed data, and store the data at cloud-scale. All these services need to run on a distributed and highly resilient cloud-scale operating system.

The SMACK stack is being used for building modern enterprise apps because it performs each of these objectives with a loosely coupled toolchain of technologies that are are all open source, and production-proven at scale.
