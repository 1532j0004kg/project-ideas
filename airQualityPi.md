# Air Quality Sensors and reporting through Twitter

### Why Air Pollution? 

At around the 42nd minute: 200,000 Americans die due to air pollution every year; 50 lakh people around the world. WTH? http://mashable.com/2016/10/04/dicaprio-mars-musk/?utm_cid=mash-com-fb-main-link#wwpKinxJF5qk

### Pi crosses 10 million

### Omega 2 or Pi Zero? 

To start things off, the Omega2 offers a 580 MHz CPU, 16 MB worth of storage and 64 MB of RAM. Meanwhile, the Pi Zero triumphs over it with a 1 GHz CPU plus 512 MB of RAM.
However, Onion also offers a more powerful version called the Omega2 Plus, and it sports two times the amount of storage and memory and a microSD slot to boot.

Between the two, only the Omega2 features built-in Wi-Fi, and to get something like that on the Pi Zero requires an add-on.

# Smart City Hackathon Effort
Sudhar et al. presented this as their project in the SCH effort in Aug 2016. 
Their presentation is available at http://j.mp/airPiKG

###Other Information
http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/chennai-air-quality-index-on-twitter/1/649648.html

This can be installed using the USD 5.00 Raspberry Pis in many places. 
And we interface with Twitter to show Coimbatore air quality. 
A worthy project.

###Project Leads 
 - Team_A - Sudharsan R (KITE, 2017) and Advik G (PSG, 2020)
 - Team_B - Who else wants to do this? 

### Timelines: 
- When do you hope to finish this project? 

### Getting Started
Building a Air Quality sensor using Raspberry PI, and we call it AirPi. The following link provided us step-by-step approach to build the AirPi [link to AirPi page](http://airpi.es/participate.php).
