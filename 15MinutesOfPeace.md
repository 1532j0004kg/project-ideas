# 15 minutes of Peace 

Good Morning Angels - MOMENTS OF PEACEFUL FORGIVENESS
When we are at peace with the self, people and situations, we tune into a frequency of forgiveness. But most of us are unable to experience peace today. If we get into a conflict with someone, we do not clear the negative thoughts created about them before entering the next scene. We carry all the emotional disturbance forward and tend to turn that scene negative too… so scene after scene we accumulate on the mind, toxic thoughts and emotions like anger, hatred, rejection or revenge. This baggage gets heavier over a period, creating a habit of finding fault and holding on to people’s mistakes. When we cannot let go, we cannot forgive.
The easiest way to forgive is to clear the clutter in the mind the moment it starts to build up, and fill the mind with peace. The more peaceful we are, the more forgiving we become. To do this, we just need to consciously create peaceful thoughts for a minute after every hour. Collecting 15 minutes of peace every day (one minute after every hour) is extremely valuable and empowering. It is like building a dam of peace across a river of gushing emotions of negativity. Withdrawing from the current scene after every 59 minutes, we can turn the mind inward and create thoughts such as these – “I am a peaceful soul radiating calmness and lightness to everyone. As a beloved child of the Supreme Soul who is The Ocean Of Peace, I reflect His qualities of unconditional forgiveness and unlimited compassion. Each one I meet today, is His child, their nature is peace. I seek forgiveness for all my mistakes. If someone wrongs me I forgive them, bless them and give them the strength to correct themselves. I heal the world by creating an atmosphere of peace and forgiveness.”
Let us experiment with this for a month and see the changes in us and others.  It not only helps to control our emotions but also slows them down. Thoughts of peace not only calm our mind but also gradually create a sanskar of forgiveness.
