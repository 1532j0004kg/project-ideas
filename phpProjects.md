A few years ago Neal Ford penned a blog post that to this day has had a major impact on the way I think about programming. The post, titled "Polyglot programming," promoted the idea that using multiple languages to power a web application will actually decrease rather than increase its complexity because you'll be able to selectively use each language to implement features that would be hard to implement in other languages.

Enter [Quercus](http://quercus.caucho.com/), a 100% Java implementation of the PHP 5 language. This implementation opens up a whole new world of possibilities for both PHP and Java developers, allowing PHP developers to take advantage of technologies such as Hibernate and Spring, while giving Java developers the opportunity to use PHP's vast assortment of extensions such as SimpleXML and PDF.
