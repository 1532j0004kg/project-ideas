## GWT Tutorial

http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/tutorial/index.html

These tutorials are intended for developers who wish to write rich AJAX applications using GWT. You might be a Java developer who would like to be able to apply the software engineering principles of object-oriented programming and leverage the tools in your Java IDE when writing applications for the web. Or you might be a JavaScript guru curious about GWTâ€™s ability to generate highly optimized JavaScript.

Although a knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Java is assumed, it is not required to run these tutorials.

These tutorials are based on the development of two example applications, such that the user learns different GWT concepts in each step.

StockWatcher is an application for monitoring stock variations, and you can get the sources from github
TodoList a web application to create and maintain a Todo checklist in browser. Sources are available at github as well.
