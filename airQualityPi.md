# Air Quality Sensors and reporting through Twitter

http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/chennai-air-quality-index-on-twitter/1/649648.html

This can be installed using the USD 5.00 Raspberry Pis in many places. 
And we interface with Twitter to show Coimbatore air quality. 
A worthy project. 


###Project Leads 
 - Team_A - Sudharsan R (KITE, 2017) and Advik G (PSG, 2020)
 - Team_B - Who else wants to do this? 

### Timelines: 
- When do you hope to finish this project? 

### Getting Started
Building a Air Quality sensor using Raspberry PI, and we call it AirPi. The following link provided us step-by-step approach to build the AirPi [link to AirPi page](http://airpi.es/participate.php).
