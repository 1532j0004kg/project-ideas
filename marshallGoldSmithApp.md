In conjunction with Doctor Kelly Goldsmith, they show with impressive results that answering just these 6 questions on a daily basis significantly affects your levels of improvement in areas such as personal engagement, happiness, meaning in life, achievement, joy and passion. In fact, you can add or invent any state or feeling and it could be yours within a few weeks.

These are the 6 daily questions that Professor Goldsmith recommends to start with: 

Did I do my best to be happy?
Did I do my best to find meaning?
Did I do my best to be fully engaged?
Did I do my best to build positive relationships?
Did I do my best to set clear goals?
Did I do my best to make progress toward goal achievement?
After just two weeks where participants asked themselves these questions every day, results showed that:

34% of people said they improved in all of the six areas
67% said they improved in four out of the six areas
91% said they got better in at least one of the areas
and nobody said they got worse.
