# Nerves for Embedded Work 

[Nerves](https://nerves-project.org/) -- Pack your whole application into as little as 12MB and have it 
start in seconds by booting a lean cross-compiled Linux directly to the battle-hardened Erlang VM. 
Let Nerves take care of the network, discovery, I/O, firmware updates, and more. 
Focus on what matters, and have fun writing robust and maintainable software. 
Nifty approach to a very real problem.
