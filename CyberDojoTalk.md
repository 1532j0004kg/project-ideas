# About CyberDojo 

Cyber-dojo helps promote deliberate practice of test driven software development, and team dynamics and collaboration. If you practice coding using your normal development environment then you are likely to be drawn into an unhelpful **"completion"** mindset. Practising in a cyber-dojo helps to combat this tendency since a cyber-dojo is so obviously not your normal development environment! 

- Practising in a cyber-dojo helps you to concentrate on the practice.
- Practising in a cyber-dojo helps you concentrate on improvement.
