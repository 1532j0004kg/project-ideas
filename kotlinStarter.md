### Why Kotlin? 

Why Kotlin For Android?
Since Android took the world by storm, developers have had no alternatives to Java app development. Although its usage is widespread, Java comes with a lot of historical baggage.
Java 8 solved some language issues and corrected even more with Java 10. In order to get much of a benefit from the corrections made in these two releases, you have to set the minimum SDK to Android 24 just to use Java 8, which isn’t an option for many developers. For almost everybody, Java 10 isn’t even on the radar.
Kotlin aims to fill that gap of a missing modern language for the Android platform. There are a few core tenets that Kotlin lives by; it strives to be:
Concise to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.
Expressive to make your code more readable and understandable.
Safe to avoid entire classes of errors such as null pointer exceptions.
Versatile for building server-side applications, Android apps or frontend code running in the browser.
Interoperable to leverage existing frameworks and libraries of the JVM with 100 percent Java interoperability.
Above all, it’s a new language! What could be more exciting? iOS developers can’t have all the fun. :]
