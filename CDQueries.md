1. What is the alternative to http://j.mp/pythonCD (launching a session in Python on "Verbal" problem using PyTest)? What if I wanted to setup for C++/GoogleTest/Verbal? 
2. Custom starting points - need to get clarity on how to do this now in the new setup
3. Migrating from one version to the other - what is the recommended steps to do this
4. How to put a wrapper for User Identification / Session tracking around CyberDojo 
5. How to link up PythonTutor, and CloudCoder with CyberDojo
6. Setting up various Javascript frameworks for legacy -> new paradigm of coding in JS
7. Procedure for upgrading CyberDo when new release is available. As of during the update, the instance is corrupting or we have to start the fresh installation, because of which we couldn't retrieve old session.
