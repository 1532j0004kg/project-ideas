# Generate ToC 

- It is quite straightforward to generate a table of contents (ToC) in Microsoft Word. Take a look at this video here -  http://bit.ly/gitHubFCC 

- Given a Markdown file (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#header), come with recommendations on how a table of contents (ToC) can be generated for it. 

- Come with a solution for generating a ToC for markdown files on github. Enhance the available github editor (https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) so that the ToC can be generated/updated while editing the github repo file from within the browser. To accomplish this, there might be some setup that is required. The less setup that is required, the better.
