An algorithm is a well defined procedure for performing a task. A household example of an algorithm is a recipe -- for example, the list of ingredients together with the sequence of instructions needed to bake a pie. In order for a computer to perform a task, it needs ingredients -- the data -- and instructions -- the algorithm.

Author John MacCormick, currently Professor of Computer Science at Dickinson College, has chosen nine important tasks performed by computers and explained the algorithms that are used. In a chapter devoted to each, he explains:
* The development of search engines -- how to find information on the internet.
* The PageRank process used by Google to produce highly relevant search results.
* Public-key cryptography, enabling secure transmission of secret messages -- such as your credit card number -- over open communication channels.
* Methods for detecting errors in data transmission and automatically correcting them.
* Several pattern recognition techniques, illustrated by classifying handwritten numbers, facial recognition, and decision trees.
* Data compression. Storing text, music, and images efficiently.
* Databases. Storing and retrieving information efficiently. Techniques for modifying databases reliably, even when computers crash while the modification is in progress.
* Digital signatures. How to be certain data is trustworthy.
* Deciding what is computable.

Even though the techniques that enable these algorithms are complex, Dr. MacCormick explains them in a clear and interesting manner using well constructed examples.
