Traditionally, since the very beginning of the computing era, enterprise software development has faced one challenge when, naturally, it is supposed to be focused on solving real business problems, but at the same time developers have to spend significant time and efforts on the technical side of the solution, such as architecture and generic functionality implementation.
In response to this disbalance between technical focused and problem oriented programming, a number of frameworks emerged, which were intended to raise the abstraction level and release developers from low level routine. Also, to increase development efficiency, development tools have become smarter and smarter over years. One of the best examples of the early 2000s is Borland Delphi, which hugely increased development speed of desktop applications.
In the past decade enterprise software has evolved a lot, raising the need for a new generation of high productivity frameworks and development tools. So, in this article we will have a look at the CUBA Platform – an open source framework, combining solid architecture, ‘must have’ features of any enterprise application and rapid application development tools, aimed to boost development productivity.
