### Q and A Bot using Microsoft Cognitive Service

A bare-bones prototype is available at https://github.com/kgashok/shiny-waffle  
It consumes the API provided https://qnamaker.ai/

#### Ideas for extension

1. Enhance the UI to do something more elegant
2. Do permanent storage 
3. Do authentication and store user favourites
4. Compare user's answer to the gold answer and provide autograding
