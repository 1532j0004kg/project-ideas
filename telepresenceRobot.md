Dear Satish, 

Nandhakumar (3rd year, KITE student) is an extremely motivated student. He has picked some good 
programming skills (especially in Python). He expressed an interest to build a robot just this evening.

Simultaneously, thanks to your idea, we want to explore building a Telepresence Robot for KGISL (software) 
and/or KG Hospital (e.g. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221250480_TelepresenceRobot_for_Home_Care_Assistance). 

Please spend some time with him to provide some direction/scope for the effort he can commit himself to.
Sudharsan (4th year passed out, KITE) with play a facilitation role in ensuring that there is continuity 
in the project for next 3-4 years. He also will coordinate with the 3D Printing student team to task them
the necessary components that might be required for the robot. 

Thanks,
