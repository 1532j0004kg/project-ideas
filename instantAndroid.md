What is App Streaming?
With App Streaming, Google allows the app content to be searchable and “streamable”, 
when any user makes a Google search from the smartphone. Users will be able to access the app content
right from the mobile browser by clicking on the “Stream” button, even if you don’t 
have the particular app installed.
