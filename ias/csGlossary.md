### Conceptual
| Term          | Description |
|---------------|:------------|
|Computer Science | is the study of special type of functions (aka Algorithms) |
|Problem Solving| The ultimate goal of Computer Scientists |
|Algorithm   |  a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise; is a special form of function (a mapping); is the [data model]?
|Graph       | the most general purpose description of representing data for an algorithm; an abstract data type; An example of one of [the simplest types of graphs is a singly linked list]!|
|Function    | a combination of [constructs][Constructs] referred to as "steps" that implement a specific algorithm |
|Data | The generic name for input and output that is provided to a function, represented usually by a combination of special cases of a Graph, including single variables to linear and non-linear data structures |
|Input       | data (a set of variables) that is provided to a function to generate the output, can be represented as a Graph |
|Output      | The return value _(s)_ of a function, can be represented as a Graph |

|Graph Algorithms | [Graph algorithms = Iterations + Data Structure?]; Implement a Syracuse Algorithm is non-deterministic?  - http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CollatzProblem.html
|Deterministic vs Non-deterministic| A computer program indeed implements a function, i.e. it maps to the input values to some uniquely defined output values. There are two **exceptions** to be considered: a program can be non-deterministic, meaning that different runs won't generate the same output; a program may fail to terminate, meaning that you are outside the domain of definition.|
|Everything is a Graph| “So in a sense, graphs can give an us an equivalent yet complementary view to the object-oriented paradigm. Where in OO we have objects in graphs we have nodes, and where in OO we have "relations between objects" in graphical models we have edges. So we can conclude that Everything is a Graph.” http://buff.ly/2fx7JBU 
|Practically, everything is a graph | Read about the propoganda  [here](http://www.tcl-sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~cornell/prolog/Propaganda.html) and [here](http://www.tcl-sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~cornell/prolog/Graphs001.html) as well  |


### Programming Related 

| Term          | Description |
|---------------|:------------|
|Why Functional Programming?| The latest (and final?) paradigm shift to  take advantage of the Utility computing era (aka Cloud Computing) which provides tremendous computing power on tap at exceptionally low cost compared to ownership. 
|Functional programming|  is a programming paradigm that conceives computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. Functional programming emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to imperative programming, which emphasizes changes in state and the execution of sequential commands. Functional programming is defined more by a set of common concerns and themes than any list of distinctions from other paradigms. Often considered important are higher-order and first-class functions, closures, and recursion. Other common features of functional programming languages are continuations, Hindley-Milner type inference systems, non-strict evaluation (including, but not limited to, "laziness"), and monads. |
|Data Structure _(PDS_1)_| Specific programming structures used for implementing abstract data type like a [graph] ADT; an array, a linked list, a hashmap; here are some new [functional data structures](http://bit.ly/functionalDS)|
|[Constructs] _(FOCP)_ | Building blocks of a program - there are 7 fundamental ones (variables, sequences, selection, repetition, function (aka sub-routines), indirection and recursion); and then there are [31 variants]
|Problem sets | A carefully curated set of problems to achieve specific learning outcomes; increase your familiarity C language constructs by tackling the problem set at http://bit.ly/kitepc1  | 
|Programming| The _art_ of writing code to accomplish problem solving using efficient algorithms |
|Object| representation of a binding of data and functions; Objects are the coupling of Function and Data 
|OOP _(PDS-2)_| Object oriented programming concepts including encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism 
|TDD | Test driven development, an important coding skill that is recommended for fresh talent that is entering the industry |
|API | Application Programming Interface, the implementation of an algorithm in a specific language/technology; The API in the [APIs Are Eating The World]
|Memory| Physical entities (bits, nibbles, CPU registers, cache, RAM, disk, tape) that help store and retrieve data

### NOTES 

#### Computer Science is the study of Special Functions (aka Algorithms) 

Binary search shows you will find the right person within 17 selections across a 1,000,000 million address book 

Graph search (or which algorithm) can help you solve the Rubik's cube in less than 21 moves....amazing isn't it? 

THE PERSUASION FOR PURE FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING 
 - Whatsapp - Erlang is at the core of it
 - Elm Programming - must faster and reliable than writing JScript code directly 

PAGE RANK ALGORITHM - contributed to a wealth creation of USD 200 billion. 
So Computer science deals with efficiency (Complexity - both time and space). 

UBER - is all about travelling salesman algorithm on steroids!  - USD 50 billion valuation
