## The Steps

So, the preferred order of operations for new features:

- Write documentation  
- Get feedback on documentation
- Test-driven development (where tests align with documentation)
- Push features to staging
- Functional testing on staging, as necessary
- Deliver feature
- Publish documentation
- Increment versions
