# Generate ToC 


## The Challenge 

- It is quite straightforward to generate a table of contents (ToC) in Microsoft Word. Take a look at this video here -  http://bit.ly/gitHubFCC 

- Given a Markdown file (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#header), come with recommendations on how a table of contents (ToC) can be generated for it. 

- Come with a solution for generating a ToC for markdown files on github. Enhance the available github editor (https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) so that the ToC can be generated/updated while editing the github repo file from within the browser. To accomplish this, there might be some setup that is required. The less setup that is required, the better. 

## Additional Notes

 - the solution must help generate **ToC** for 
	 - wiki pages (e.g https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Wiki/wiki) when the user clicks on the "Edit" button next to the green "New Page" button, on the right hand side
	 - markdown files in the repo (e.g. https://github.com/MarkUsProject/Wiki/blob/master/Admin_FAQ.md) when the user clicks on the pencil icon next to the History button on the right hand side, below the "Copy path" button
	 - gist pages (e.g. https://gist.github.com/kgashok/1be5157b5c2225b5948cc73d153bf531) when the user clicks the "Edit" button next to the "Delete" icon on the top right hand side 

## Example 

The gist page (https://gist.github.com/kgashok/1be5157b5c2225b5948cc73d153bf531) has a table of contents, which is what we need to create based on any given page (wiki, md file or gist file on **github**).
