## Python for Data analysis 

http://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/

This textbook will guide you through an investigation of money in politics using data from the California Civic Data Coalition.

You will learn just enough of the Python computer programming language to work with the pandas library, a popular open-source tool for analyzing data. The course will teach you how to use pandas to read, filter, join, group, aggregate and rank structured data.

You will also learn how to record, remix and republish your analysis using the Jupyter Notebook, a browser-based application for writing code that is emerging as the standard for sharing reproducible research in the sciences.
