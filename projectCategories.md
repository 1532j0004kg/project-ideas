4 broad categories of projects

1. India Hackathon (2017) - how many have applied? Who is tracking this? 
2. IndiaStack (http://buildonindiastack.in/, https://yourstory.com/2017/08/winners-buildonindiastack-get-mentorship-nandan-nilekani/) - 
3. AI-related Projects (RPA, Speech, Virtual Assistant) 
4. All others (Misc. including KGISL-specific, Education specific, healthcare specific)

**Virtual Agents**: “The current darling of the media,” says Forrester (I believe they refer 
to my evolving relationships with Alexa), from simple chatbots to advanced systems that can network 
with humans. Currently used in customer service and support and as a smart home manager. 
**Sample vendors**: Amazon, Apple, Artificial Solutions, Assist AI, Creative Virtual, Google, IBM, IPsoft, Microsoft, Satisfi.

**Robotic Process Automation**: Using scripts and other methods to automate human action to support 
efficient business processes. Currently used where it’s too expensive or inefficient for humans to 
execute a task or a process. 
**Sample vendors**: Advanced Systems Concepts, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, UiPath, WorkFusion.

**Speech Recognition**: Transcribe and transform human speech into format useful for computer applications. 
Currently used in interactive voice response systems and mobile applications. 
**Sample vendors**: NICE, Nuance Communications, OpenText, Verint Systems.

We are already in two categories. We should build momentum in those areas. 
@Ramya V like CoderDojo club, we must have a VirtualAssitant Club 
(assign yourself + KITE/CAS student) and an RPA Club (assign Dushyanth + KITE/CAS student). 
At least 3-4 teams must deliver projects in these areas.
